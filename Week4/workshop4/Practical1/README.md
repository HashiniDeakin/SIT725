# SIT 725 Week 4 Practical - Databases

This repository contains the code for SIT 725 Week 4 Practical, focusing on integrating a backend server with a REST API and MongoDB database. The project builds upon Week 3 by serving dynamic card data through a Node.js server and connecting to a MongoDB database.

## Setup
- Node.js and Express for the backend server.
- MongoDB for the NoSQL database.
- Materialize CSS for the frontend.
- Files are organized with static assets in the `public` folder.

## Instructions
1. Install dependencies: `npm install`.
2. Ensure MongoDB is running locally or via MongoDB Atlas.
3. Run the server: `node server.js`.
4. Access the application at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Repository Structure
- `server.js`: Node.js server with REST API.
- `public/`: Static files (index.html, css/styles.css, js/scripts.js, images/).
